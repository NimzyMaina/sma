The work involved debuging the application in order to make sure it can add sales on the mobile app and the amount paid reflects on 
the database. In the current state the mobile up can add a sale but the amount paid is not refecting in the system. 

On the front end of the system, the user should be able to edit sale made in the system. The error is that the sale ID is not being
 picked up from the database.
